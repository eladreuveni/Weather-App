Hi, this is my Weather app.

in order to run it:

"npm i";
"npm start";

enjoy!

We have an autocomplete for cities,
A five days weather forecast,
An options to mark my favorites cities,
And in the meantime enjoy some pictures of the destinations.

Please note that I'm using some free api's end-points so it has several call amount restrictions.
